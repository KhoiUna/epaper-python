# Instructions

- First, create an [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) account so we can get temperature data and display it on our ePaper.
- Then, go to [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) to obtain your API key.
- After that:

1. `git clone https://github.com/KhoiUna/python-epaper.git`
2. `cd epaper-python/examples`
3. Go to file `demo.py` to change the line `API_key = "<YOUR API KEY>"`. Replace `<YOUR API KEY>` with the API key you've just obtained.
4. `python demo.py` or `python3 demo.py`
